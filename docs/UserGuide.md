### Check availability on a specific date and time: `check` (Marcus Tan)
Would you like to check if you happen to be free at a certain time? The check command allows you to scan through your events to check for any events you might have within a given time period.

Format: `check [START_DATE]; [START_TIME]; [END_DATE]; [END_DATE]`

Acceptable date formats: DD/MM/YYYY or DD/MM/YY

Acceptable time formats: 
- 24 Hour format – HHmm or HH:mm (e.g. 14:00)
- 12 Hour format – hh:mm am/pm or hhmm am/pm (e.g. 2:00 pm)

Example: `check 20/08/2020; 15:05; 25/08/2020; 13:00`

This will check from 20 August 2020 3:05pm to 25 August 2020 1pm. 

Expected result:
```
_________________________________
check 20/08/2020; 15:05; 25/08/2020; 13:00
_________________________________
You have no coinciding events!
_________________________________
```
{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed noteBox"}}
**Note!**

-	You may omit the DD or DD/MM in a date. If you do not fill in these fields for the date, the command takes the current date for that field by default (e.g.  input 2021 on 11 Oct 2020 would be taken as 11/10/2021)
-	The date can also be omitted entirely. If you leave a date field as blank, the command takes the current date for that field by default.
-	You may also omit the minutes in a time. If the minutes(MM) field of any time is empty, the time is read as when the hour begins (e.g. 4 pm would be taken as 4:00 pm)
-	The time can also be omitted entirely. If you leave a time field as blank, the command takes the current time by default.

{{box op="end"}}

{{box op="start" cssClass="boxed warningBox"}}
**Warning!**

- Even when you leave a time field (e.g. `[START_DATE]`) as blank, a semicolon (;) should still be used to denote the blank field (e.g. `check ; 2:00 pm; 25/12/2020; 2359`)
{{box op="end"}}

### Goal setting and viewing: goal (Marcus Ng)

### Mark events as done: `done` (Marcus Tan)
If you would like to mark an event as done, you can use the done command to do so. 

Format: `done EVENT_TYPE EVENT_INDEX [EVENT_DATE]` 

Acceptable date formats: DD/MM/YYYY or DD/MM/YY 

If you wish to mark a specific event in a repeated task as done, you may enter the date of that repeated event.

Examples:
-	`done personal 1` marks the 1st Personal event as done.
-	`done personal 2 1/3/2020` if the 2nd Personal event is a repeated event with a repetition occurring on 1st March 2020, that repetition will be marked as done 

Expected output:
```
_________________________________
done personal 2 1/3/2020
_________________________________
You have successfully marked this event as done!
[P][✓] test 2 on 2020-03-01, 14:00
_________________________________
```

### Mark events as not done: `undone` (Marcus Tan)
Did you accidentally mark an event as done? Not to worry, just use the undone command to set the event status back to undone.

Format: `undone EVENT_TYPE EVENT_INDEX [EVENT_DATE]`

Acceptable date formats: DD/MM/YYYY or DD/MM/YY 

If you wish to mark a specific event in a repeated task as undone, you may enter the date of that repeated event.

Examples:
-	`undone zoom 3` marks the 3rd Zoom event as not done.
-	`undone personal 2 1/3/2020` if the 2nd Personal event is a repeated event with a repetition occurring on 1st March 2020, that repetition will be marked as undone 

Expected output:
```
_________________________________
undone personal 2 1/3/2020
_________________________________
You have successfully marked this event as undone!
[P][✕] test 2 on 2020-03-01, 14:00
_________________________________
```


### Deleting an event: `delete` (Marcus Tan)
Want to remove an event from your schedule? Use the delete command to get rid of unnecessary events.

Format: `delete EVENT_TYPE; EVENT_INDEX; [EVENT_DATE]`

Examples:
-	`delete personal 3` deletes the 3rd Personal event from Scheduler.

Expected output:
```
_________________________________
delete personal 3
_________________________________
You have successfully deleted this event!
[P][✕] test 3 on 2020-01-01
_________________________________
```

### Note Taking: note (Qing Ning)

### Reminder: reminder (Qing Ning)

### Extracting events from texts: extract (Matthew Gani)

### Save events: events (Colin)
